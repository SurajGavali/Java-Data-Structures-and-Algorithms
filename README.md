## Stack Using Array

### Files
- /Stacks/StackApp.java is a main file.
- /Stacks/stack/ folder you will find two files which are "stack of charcters" and "stack of longs".
- In Operations.java file I have written functions that will do some basic operations on stack and some use cases of stack.
---
## Operations.java
### basicStackOperations()
- This will add the long numbers to stack and pops the data from stack and prints it
### checkDelimeter()
- For example, "a{b(c)d}e" is a valid expression because opening and closing brackets matches each other sequentially.
- Similarly, "a{b(c]d}e" is a Invalid expression because opening and closing brackets do not matches each other sequentially.
