## Stacks
- Using Arrays
### Files
- /Stacks/StackApp.java is a main file.
- /Stacks/stack/ folder you will find two files which are "stack of charcters" and "stack of longs".
- In DelimeterMatching.java file I have written code that will check whether the given expression is correct or not using stacks functionality.

<p> For example, "a{b(c)d}e" is a valid expression because opening and closing brackets matches each other sequentially. </p>
<p> Similarly, "a{b(c]d}e" is a Invalid expression because opening and closing brackets do not matches each other sequentially. </p>
