# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

<p>In this Repository you will learn about Java Data Structures and algorithms</p>

## Stack Using Array

### Files
- /Stacks/StackApp.java is a main file.
- /Stacks/stack/ folder you will find two files which are "stack of charcters" and "stack of longs".
- In Operations.java file I have written functions that will do some basic operations on stack and some use cases of stack.
---
## Operations.java
### basicStackOperations()
- This will add the long numbers to stack and pops the data from stack and prints it
### checkDelimeter()
- For example, "a{b(c)d}e" is a valid expression because opening and closing brackets matches each other sequentially.
- Similarly, "a{b(c]d}e" is a Invalid expression because opening and closing brackets do not matches each other sequentially.

## Queue Using Array

### Files
- /Queues/QueueApp.java is a main file.
- /Queues/queue/ folder you will find Queue.java file which has all the basic operations of queue.
- In QueueOperations.java file I have written functions that will do some basic operations on queue and some use cases of queue.
---
## QueueOperations.java
### basicQueueOperations()
- This will add the numbers to queue and removes the numbers from queue and prints it.
